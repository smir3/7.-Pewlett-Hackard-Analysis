# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

Purpose: Pewlett Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. Soon, they are expecting the baby boomers to begin retiring at a rapid rate. Pewlett Hackard would like to start filling in the upcoming vacancies and preparing retirement packages. My job is to help with generating a list of all employees eligible for retirement. 

Task Deliverables:
I will need to help the up and coming HR analyst, Bobby, with building an employee database with SQL by applying datamodelling, engineering, and analysis skills. This analysis will provide insight on the number of retiring employees by title and the employees eligible for the mentorship program. This will help prepare Pewlett Hackard for the many retirements soon.  

The deliverables for this anaylsis are as follows:

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)

Results: 

Deliverable 1:
As seen in the retirement_titles csv file, there are 133776 roles which will be opening up. 
These include roles where a single individual had 2 titles (ex. senior staff and staff). A

Deliverbale 2:
According to the unique titles document there are 90398 unique roles which will be opening up. 
According to the retiring titles csv, there are 2382 titles. According to mentorship eligibility, there are 1549


Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
